# Algorithm
<p>Study Computer Algorithm with CLRS</p>

# If you want to view code
<p>1.  Open src repository</p>
<p>2.  Find .h File (All algorithm function are declared and commented in .h file)</p>
<p>3.  Open .cpp File which you want to view (Function name is same with .cpp file name)</p>
<p>4.  Test.cpp is source code which measure execution time of algorithm (Just test, not formalized)</p>
# Comment Template
<p>I write comment of function in .h file on under template</p>
<p>someday template can be changed</p>
 
<pre><code>
/*
