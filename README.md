# Algorithm
Study Computer Algorithm with CLRS

# If you want to view code
1.  Open src repository
2.  Find .h File (All algorithm function are declared and commented in .h file)
3.  Open .cpp File which you want to view (Function name is same with .cpp file name)
4.  Test.cpp is source code which measure execution time of algorithm (Just test, not formalized)

# Comment Template
I write comment of function in .h file on under template 
someday template can be changed
